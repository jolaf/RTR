The command line syntax is as follows:

 RTR.EXE ( Render | Show )  [ Quiet ]  < File_Name >  [ Switches ]

 - Command line is not case sensitive.
 - You can use only the first letter of words "Build", "Show" or "Quiet"
   instead of typing them wholy.
 - One and only one of commands "Render" and "Show" must be specified.
   Type no command to see this help screen.
 - Quite option suppresses the most of text information printed while working.
 - File_Name is a name of file for writing the screen shots to or for showing.
 - Any one of the symbols '/', '\', '+', '-' can be used as switch separator.
 - Switches order and spacing are not important, switches can be also grouped
   using only one switch separator, for example "/mns" instead of "/m /s /n".
 - Only one switch from each list can present, the first switch in the list
   is selected by default.

              One of 'v' or 's' switches MUST be used if rendering to memory.
  - c, t, p : To select Cycling, Back-and-Forth or Ping-Pong viewing mode for

  - d, m    : To render screen shots for film to the screen or to the memory.
              If rendering to memory, 'v' or 's' switch must be used to select
